  testing the tool.

## Development

You will need:

- A recent (Rust nightly)[https://rustup.rs/]
- The (MSVC toolchain)[https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus/]

Most building functions are exposed by the (xtasks)[https://github.com/matklad/cargo-xtask].

### Run the tool

```
cargo xtask run
```

This task will compile and run the practice tool from the repo.

### Distribution artifacts

```
cargo xtask dist
```

This task will create release artifacts in `target/dist/jdsd_er_practice_tool.zip`.

### Codegen

```
cargo xtask codegen
```

This task is responsible for generating Rust code from various external sources.
Examples: params from [Paramdex](https://github.com/soulsmods/Paramdex), base pointers for
array-of-byte scans from the Elden Ring executables.

### Environment

Some tasks require you to have environment variables defined that are dependent on your system.
You can put all your task-specific environment variables in a `.env` file in the top level directory
of the project. Complete example:

```
$ cat .env
ERPT_PATCHES_PATH="C:/Videogames/EldenRingPatches"
```
