### Environment

Some tasks require you to have environment variables defined that are dependent on your system.
You can put all your task-specific environment variables in a `.env` file in the top level directory
of the project. Complete example:

```
eldenring-practice-tool$ cat .env
ERPT_PATCHES_PATH="C:/Videogames/EldenRingPatches"
```
