Welcome to the Elden Ring Practice Tool!

To run the tool, double-click jdsd_er_practice_tool.exe while the game is running.
To install the no-logo mod, copy `dinput8.dll` in the game's directory, next to `eldenring.exe`.

The `steam_appid.txt` method of EAC bypass is the only one supported.

If you have issues or questions, thoroughly check the FAQ.
If you can't find what you need there, feel free to open an issue or join the discord.
